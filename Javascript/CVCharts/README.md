# CVCharts

**Note: The site is no longer displaying charts correctly. It may be a result of the data set growing so large over the course of two years, or the JSON format has been modified. I have not had time to investigate this issue and modify the code accordingly.**

This is a one page site providing visual charts of COVID-19 data for some select states in the US.

This project uses HTML and CSS with [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) for presentation.

Charts are drawn with [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/)

Data is populated with JQuery from JSON provided by <https://covidtracking.com/> and processed using JavaScript.

Site is available at <http://mikehess.net/cvcharts/>
