This Python program replicates the Hangman word guessing game.  The program will choose a random word from a pre-defined array of words and ask you to guess a letter.  If you guess correctly, the location of the letter within the word will be displayed and ask you to guess another letter.  Continue guessing until you've solved the puzzle.  But if you guess incorrectly 6 times, you lose!
